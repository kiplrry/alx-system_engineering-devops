- **Root Cause**: The culprit behind this cosmic chaos? A misconfigured load balancer, sending our web traffic on a wild journey to the wrong servers.

## Timeline:

- **10:00 AM**: Monitoring alerts lit up like a Christmas tree, warning us of impending disaster.
- **10:05 AM**: Engineers embarked on a quest to slay the database dragon, only to find it was merely a red herring.
- **10:20 AM**: With databases clear of guilt, suspicion turned to the load balancer, the miscreant in this tale.
- **10:40 AM**: Engineers attempted a rollback, hoping to turn back the clock and undo the chaos. Alas, it was not to be.
- **11:00 AM**: The baton was passed to the infrastructure team as the mystery deepened.
- **11:30 AM**: A Sherlockian investigation revealed the load balancer's misdeeds, routing traffic amiss.
- **12:00 PM**: Order was restored as the load balancer was reconfigured, bringing balance back to the e-commerce galaxy.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause**: Like a mischievous poltergeist, a misconfiguration haunted our load balancer, leading to its erratic behavior.
  
- **Resolution**: With the misconfiguration exorcised, the load balancer resumed its duty, guiding traffic to the correct servers. Peace was restored to the digital realm.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Implement automated load balancer configuration checks to catch mischievous misconfigurations in the act.

  - Craft a rollback plan worthy of a hero's journey, ready to rescue us from future fiascos.
  
- **Tasks to Address the Issue**:
  1. Enlist the aid of automation tools to keep a watchful eye on load balancer configurations.
  2. Equip our monitoring arsenal with the latest weaponry to detect anomalies before they wreak havoc.
  3. Document a playbook for rollback procedures, complete with illustrations for added flair.
  4. Conduct a post-mortem of recent infrastructure changes, leaving no stone unturned in our quest for stability.
